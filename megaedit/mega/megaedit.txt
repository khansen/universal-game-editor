        Mega Man I & II
        level    editor
        ===============

        MegaMan1.NES and/or MegaMan2.NES must reside in same dir as MegaEdit.

        Left mouse button:      Plot currently selected tile at cursor.
                                Select tile from tileset on the right.
        Right mouse button:     Pick up tile at cursor.

        F1      - Next level
        F5      - Save changes
        TAB     - Next tile set
        Left    - Move one column left
        Right   - Ditto right
        PgDown  - Move 8 columns (one screen) left
        PgUp    - Ditto right
        ESC     - Exit

        Problems:

        Some of the tilesets are screwed up, making the corresponding levels
        very awkward to edit. :( (Especially in MM2)

        Can't edit how/where the scrolling changes direction.

        Can't edit MegaMan3-6 (yet), because level data format is slightly
        different.
