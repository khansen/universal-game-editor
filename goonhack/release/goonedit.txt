        How it works
        ------------

        Should be pretty straight-forward (especially if you've
        already used one of my other level editors):

        - Draw a texture at the desired screen position by moving the
          mouse to this position, then press LEFT mouse button. A
          flashing box always shows which part of the screen will be
          affected.

        - Select the texture to use from the set of textures at the
          bottom of the screen with the LEFT mouse button. Press TAB
          to browse through the different sets for the current level.
          (LShift+TAB to select the previous set). The selected
          texture can be seen in the bottom right corner of the
          screen.

        - You can also select a texture to use directly from the level
          data, by holding the mouse over the desired texture, and then
          pressing RIGHT mouse button.

        - LEFT arrow key scrolls one room left in the area.

        - RIGHT arrow key scrolls one room right in the area.

        - F1 selects the next area in the game.

        - F5 saves your changes.
