        This program requires a mouse. Hopefully, you have one.

        How to use it
        -------------

        Selecting textures:

        Select the texture you want to use from the set of texture
        at the right of the screen by pointing at it and then
        clicking LEFT mouse button. To select a texture from the
        room data itself, point on the texture you want to use and
        press RIGHT mouse button to select it. The currently
        selected texture is always displayed in the lower right
        corner of the screen.

        Press TAB to bring up the next set of textures. All levels
        have lots of sets, so press TAB multiple times to browse
        through all of them. Press LShift+TAB to select the
        previous set.

        Drawing textures:
        
        Press LEFT mouse button at the appropriate screen position
        to paste it in.

        Moving around in the level:

        Hold your mouse in the upper region of the screen to move
        further UP in the level.
        Hold your mouse in the lower region of the screen to move
        DOWN in the level.
        Press PageUp/PageDown on your keyboard to move an entire
        page at a time.

        Changing levels:

        Press F1 to change to the next level.
