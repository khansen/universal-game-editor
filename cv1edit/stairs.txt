        OK, first let me define what I mean by "a set of stairs"
        in Castlevania. Each stairway on the screen is actually
        two stairs: one leading up, and one leading down.

                                         +--- <-- Stairs II (top)
                                         |
                                     +---+
                                     |
                                 +---+
                                 |
        Stairs I (bottom) --> ---+

        So there is separate data for each of the stairs. The
        only data they share is the room number where the stairs
        should be applied (see below).


18019h - %yyyytttt

        yyyy:   Y start position of stairs. Multiply by 16
                to get real offset on screen.

        tttt:   Stairs type. There are four different kinds:

                0: Stairs going up right.
                1: Stairs going up left.
                2: Stairs going down left.
                3: Stairs going down right.

1801Ah - %xxxxrrrr

        xxxx:   X start position of stairs. Multiply by 16
                to get real offset on screen.

        rrrr:   Level offset. This nibble refers to which
                room in the current portion of the level
                the stairs should be applied to.
                Multiply by 48 (size of one room) to get
                real offset in level data.

1801Bh - %yyyytttt

        yyyy:   Y end position of stairs. Multiply by 16
                to get real offset on screen.

        tttt:   Stairs type. Should be the exact opposite
                of the type defined in 18019h (see above).

1801Ch - %xxxx??pp

        xxxx:   X end position of stairs. Multiply by 16
                to get real offset on screen.

        pp:     Properties for the stairs leading down.
                01b = Simon can only walk up
                10b = Simon can walk both up and down
