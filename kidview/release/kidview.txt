Kid Icarus level data viewer
by SnowBro <kentmhan@online.no>

Well, after hours of studying KIDICAR.NES with NESticle and a hex editor,
I've finally figured out the location of all the level data, as well as
its format. Over thousand lines of text is the result of my research, and
I had originally intended it to be a tutorial, but instead it ended up
as a huge reference containing info only needed by people interested in
writing a level editor. Anyway, I'm releasing this little program to
show you that I should have enough info to make such a level editor now.
So far you can only VIEW the rooms however, not make any changes to
them. But I'm working on it.

To use the viewer, KIDICAR.NES must be present in the same directory as
the executable kidview.exe. (I will NOT supply you with the ROM image.
Please don't ask me to send it to you.)

To view a level's data, type "kidview [level]",
where [level] is one of the following values:

        1: Level 1-1, 1-2, 1-3
        2: Level 2-1, 2-2, 2-3
        3: Level 3-1, 3-2, 3-3
        4: Level 1-4, 2-4, 3-4
        5: Level 4-1

Change the current room by using left and right arrow keys.

Press spacebar to see how the room is set up, one object at a time.
Quite interesting, huh? Perhaps it will give you a clue on what the
format of the level data looks like, and how a simple room editor
would work.

Note that each sub-level uses a different palette, but the viewer doesn't
account for this, so the colors in some levels (1-2, for example) aren't
correct. This will be fixed of course.
