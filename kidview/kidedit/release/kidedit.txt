        Kid Icarus level editor v1.0
        by SnowBro <kentmhan@online.no>

        With this program you are able to alter the appearance
        of the timeless NES classic, "Kid Icarus". I've spent
        a lot of time hacking/decoding the different formats
        used by the game, and this editor is the result of
        my research.


        Keys
        -=-=

        F1              - change level
        F5              - save changes
        Arrow keys      - move object
        A               - select previous object
        S               - select next object
        (LShift +) TAB  - change graphical structure
        2               - change upper 2 bits of object's color
        LShift + left   - go to previous room in level
        LShift + right  - go to next room in level
        INS             - insert a new object
        DEL             - delete current object

        Play around with it a bit and the various features
        will become clear.


        Shortcomings
        =-=-=-=-=-=-

        Note that you cannot insert an unlimited amount of objects.
        The number of objects in a room cannot exceed the original
        amount of objects in that particular room; there simply
        isn't any space for it in the ROM.
        
        Also note that some of the map positions share the same
        room data... "Kid Icarus" uses a lot of the rooms multiple
        times (especially in Level 4-1), so be careful. What this
        means is that if you edit a room that is used more than
        once, ALL occurances of this room will be changed, since
        they all use the same room data.

        Level 1-4, 2-4 and 3-4 aren't editable yet. And I don't
        know if they ever will, still haven't figured out exactly
        how the format of the map data is. But there's little
        point in editing them anyway, because the SAME room data
        is used in all three levels.


        Things to do
        =-=-=-=-=-=-

        Figure out where the enemy information is stored. The goal
        is to be able to see the enemies in the editor, and change
        their position/type/health/damagelevel.
