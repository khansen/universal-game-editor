        Ghosts'n Goblins level editor v1.0
        by SnowBro <kentmhan@online.no>

        This program, unlike my other level editors, is mouse-driven
        (at least the main editing). Hope you like it.

        GNG.NES available separately.


        How to use it
        -------------

        Selecting tiles:

        Select the 16x16 tile you want to use from the set of tiles
        at the right of the screen by pointing at it and then
        clicking LEFT mouse button. To select a tile from the
        room data itself, point on the tile you want to use and
        press RIGHT mouse button to select it.

        Press TAB to bring up other sets of tiles. Most of the levels
        have 2 or more sets, so press TAB multiple times to browse
        through all of them.

        Drawing tiles:
        
        Press LEFT mouse button at the appropriate screen position
        to paste it in.

        Changing levels:

        Press F1 to change to the next level/next part of the level.

        Use the arrow keys (left/right) on your keyboard to move
        around in the selected level.

        Saving:

        Press F5 to save the changes you've made.
