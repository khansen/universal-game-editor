07B10h: 2x2 tile defines. This format is kinda weird. Instead of
        defining the four tile indexes for each macro sequentially,
 

07310h: The data starting at this offset consists of 4-byte chunks.
        Each byte refers to a 2x2 tile macro defined elsewhere in
        the ROM.

10010h: Room data. Each byte refers to one of the 4-byte chunks.
